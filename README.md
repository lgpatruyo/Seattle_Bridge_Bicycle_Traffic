# Seattle_Bridge_Bicycle_Traffic

The objective is to practice analysis and visualization techniques when working with time series.

The dataset comes from an automated bicycle counter, installed in late 2012, which has inductive sensors on the east and west sidewalks of the bridge. 

The dataset was last updated on May 3, 2021.

The dataset with hourly bicycle counts can be downloaded from here: [Fremont_Bridge_Bicycle_Counter](https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Fremont-Bridge-Bicycle-Counter/65db-xm6k)
